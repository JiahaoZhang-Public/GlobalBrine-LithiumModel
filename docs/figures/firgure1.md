## **1. Content Description**

- **What the image represents**
    
    A **global (world) map** displaying the spatial distribution of **Li⁺ crystallization rate (h)** together with **site-specific Li⁺/Mg²⁺ selectivity values**. The figure integrates spatially continuous background data with discrete observational points to illustrate global and regional trends.
    
- **Scientific domain**
    
    **Materials science / electrochemistry / chemical engineering**, with relevance to **lithium extraction, crystallization processes, and ion-selective separation**.
    
- **Main components and data elements**
    1. **Base map**
        - World map with simplified country boundaries shown in thin gray lines.
        - Latitude and longitude labels appear along the map margins, providing geographic reference.
    2. **Gridded background layer (discrete color legend)**
        - Coastal and regionally defined grid cells are filled with color-coded patches representing **Li⁺ crystallization rate (h)**.
        - A **discrete color legend** labeled **“Li⁺ crystallization rate (h)”** defines binned rate ranges.
        - Cooler colors correspond to lower crystallization rates, while warmer colors indicate higher rates.
        - The gridded layer emphasizes spatial variability in Li⁺ crystallization behavior across different regions.
    3. **Point observations (foreground symbols)**
        - Circular markers placed at specific geographic locations represent measured or reported **Li⁺/Mg²⁺ selectivity** values.
        - Marker **size and color intensity** increase with increasing selectivity, allowing rapid visual comparison among sites.
    4. **Point-symbol legend**
        - A separate legend labeled **“Li⁺/Mg²⁺ selectivity”** shows a series of circles increasing in size and color saturation.
        - Each symbol corresponds to a defined selectivity range, explaining how point magnitude is encoded.
- **Relationships conveyed**
    - The figure visually links **regional Li⁺ crystallization rates** (background) with **local Li⁺/Mg²⁺ selectivity performance** (points), enabling comparison between large-scale spatial trends and site-specific separation efficiency.

## **2. Visualization Style Description**

- **Type of figure**
    
    **Geospatial thematic map** combining a **binned raster background** with **proportional-symbol point markers**.
    
- **Level of abstraction**
    
    **Highly schematic and analytical**, focusing on quantitative comparison rather than geographic detail.
    
- **Color palette**
    - **Discrete, sequential color scale** for Li⁺ crystallization rate (h), transitioning from cool tones (low rates) to warm tones (high rates).
    - Point markers use a compatible warm-color progression to represent increasing Li⁺/Mg²⁺ selectivity.
- **Line style and thickness**
    - Thin gray lines for country borders.
    - Minimal coastlines with no terrain shading.
    - A bold black outline frames the figure panel.
- **Typography**
    - Clear, sans-serif font with scientific notation for ions (Li⁺, Mg²⁺).
    - Legends include units and concise labels without extraneous annotation.
- **Layout and composition**
    - Single-panel world map.
    - **Discrete color legend** for Li⁺ crystallization rate positioned to the side of the map.
    - **Point-symbol legend** for Li⁺/Mg²⁺ selectivity placed near the lower portion of the figure.
    - Balanced spacing ensures legibility without obscuring data.
- **Overall tone**
    - **Professional, publication-ready, and data-centric**, suitable for high-impact journals in materials science, electrochemistry, or resource engineering.
